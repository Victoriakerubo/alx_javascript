# HTML Form + JS Validation

This project covers the fundamentals of HTML forms and JavaScript validation for client-side form processing.

#Learning Objectives

- Understand client-side validation.
- Implement basic form validation using JavaScript.
- Handle form submissions and perform data validation using JavaScript.

# Tasks

0. Form Validation - Password Strength

- Create an HTML form with a dynamic number of text input fields based on the selected value in a dropdown menu.
- Generate the specified number of text input fields dynamically.
- Ensure all dynamically generated fields are filled before submitting the form.
- Display an error message if any of the fields are empty.
- Use JavaScript event listeners to detect changes in the dropdown menu selection and handle form submission.

3. Form Submission Handling

- Implement JavaScript to handle form submission and perform validation.
- Prevent default form submission behavior.
- Retrieve form field values using JavaScript.
